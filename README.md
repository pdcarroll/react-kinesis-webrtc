# React Kinesis WebRTC

An experimental library of React hooks for the [amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc-sdk-js](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc-sdk-js) library.

Provides a simple, declarative API that can handle peer-to-peer connections within React components.

**This library is still experimental and is therefore not yet suitable for production.**

## Getting Started

Install the library:

```shell
$ npm install react-kinesis-webrtc
```

Import KVS WebRTC hooks into your React project:

```javascript
import { useMaster, useViewer } from "react-kinesis-webrtc";
```
